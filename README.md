# Fashion-MNIST-Classification-with-TensorFlow-and-Keras
  This repository contains a simple implementation of a neural network using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset.The code demonstrates the essential steps of loading the dataset,             preprocessing the data, building a neural network model, training the model, and evaluating its performance. It serves as an educational resource for those new to TensorFlow and Keras, providing a foundation for             understanding image classification tasks in machine learning.

# Features:
  Loads and preprocesses the Fashion MNIST dataset.
  Builds a neural network model with a basic architecture.
  Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for implementation.
  Includes comments and documentation for improved readability.

# Usage:
